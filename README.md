# Fashion-MNIST
My implementaion on a neural network for Fashion-MNIST

It's just same model as following link's

https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification

Convolution layer is not working.

I need to make learning process of that.

Also I didn't make it run parallel. YET.


U need OpenCV to run it. (I choose it cuz converTo is very useful func)
